            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48383:3"/>great wilde-fowle which are yet very fat, I know their haunts, I ſpyed out their taking wing to flie abroad, I followed, and ſaw them houſed, and like an olde ſetting dog, I traced them back againe to their ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holes, doe you think that this newes will not bee welcome to M <hi>Tenterhooke?</hi> I ſaith I think you and he could as ill ſubſiſt without me, as a new upſet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary could without the cuſtome of ſome well practiſed Phyſitian. He aſſure you, if the officers of the Counter had any charity in them, they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remember ſuch as I am for their ſpeciall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, and upholders; I have ſent them in five or ſixe couple of rich feathered fowles in a weeke, which they have pulled bare, and devoured in a week after; no Poulterer can ſooner unplume a Partridge than thoſe Coyſterels can a prodigall youngſter in the poultry; yonder is the man we looked for, he is ſtirring betimes, I beleeve he is going about ſome Ambuſcado, come, we will up to him: how doe you Maſter <hi>Tenterhooke?</hi>

Thoſe who are called ſpirits, that catch men for new plantations, are meere butter-flies to us; if once we utter but our terrible Apologie, <hi>The King greets you,</hi> into what a ſhaking fit puts it men into, our preſſing men into the Counter, is more dreadfull than a Conſtables is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings ſervice.</p>

               <p>Doe but obſerve what a confeſſion the young gallant will make when he is taken, oh how I rejoyce to heare him, he does it in hope to finde mercy at our hands, alas, it is much like that which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48383:4"/>Thieves make at the place of execution, without any pitty or hope of pardon; A man may as well looke for mercy at the hands of an Argiere pirate, as at a Serjeants, for we are as cruell by land, as they are by Sea, they paſſe them away to the Gallies, and we to the Gallowes. When we cope ſuch a Sparke at any time, the firſt place of debating the matter, is, if hee be well lined with monies, the next Taverne, but if he be a bird but of an ordinary flight, then the next rotten, olde, darke Alehouſe, our intent is there to gorge our ſelves upon him, as ſo many Carrion Crowes, and to fiſh out of him whether he be in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther danger or not, and ſometimes it is to ſend in the interim to the Creditor, to give him intelligence that <hi>long looked for is come at laſt,</hi> and to bid to haſte to the Counter, and enter the action againſt him, for that is an uſuall trade with us, firſt to arreſt a man, and then enter the action a little antidated, that our knavery may be concealed.</p>

               <p>Tuſh, that is as uſuall as it is for young wenches, firſt to adventure a great belly, and when they are ſped, then to procure a Licence, but how we ſqueeze him in the interim, he might have ſitten as eaſily bare buttockt upon thornes all the while, as to have ſtayed there amongſt us, if we give him liberty to ſend Letters to any of his friends, <hi>Spiall,</hi> or he that we ſend, knowes how to protract time, or goe about other buſineſſe, or to ſay they were not at home, or elſe he would goe againe anon to their houſes, and all this the poore gull takes for great curteſies from us, when it is nothing leſſe, for we doe it either to have the longer time to feaſt our ſelves in, or elſe to gaine monies of him for keeping him as we ſay for going to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48383:5"/>the Counter, or to put him into the greater feares, while we ſit and laugh at him.</p>

               <p>This is all as true as Goſpel, but my nimble villaines, there is more you know in it than all this; you know a priviledge that I have beyond all this, for if I ſmell that he is well lined with gold no Chymiſt hath more dexterity to extract ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate gold from other Minerals, than I have to ſcrue mettall out of his feathered pockets, I have a tricke under the vizzard of extraordinary curteſie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to drill this Buſſard home to my rooſte, where I finde lodging at ten ſhillings a night, and dyet with a ſhoulder of Mutton, and a Capon, at thirty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with the ſauce; Vintners reckonings are often paid with brawling and quarrelling, but I have all paid me with hearty thankes, and a prayer to boote, to be good unto him, if in caſe I ſee he will be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, I am ſure one or two daies to keep out of ſight of purpoſe, that his friends may ſpend the freer, and his ſcore run the higher; beſides when I do come in, I make as though I was ſorry for the Gentlemans trouble, when as it is a thouſand to one, but I have been entring ſome other new action againſt him, or elſe informed ſome of his other Creditors to doe it while he is in Limbo, and then he and his friends will pay any thing to quit him of my houſe, when alas poore bird, I have agreed with another of my brethren to take him in againe as ſoone as I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, beſide all this I have a deviſe to goe to his Creditors, to deſire them not to be ſeen in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as yet, telling them alſo, that if they keep off, and not cloze too ſoon with him, they may have their full debt and charges, when as all this while I doe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48383:5"/>worke only to ſpin out my priſoner to the higheſt ſtraine, as Nuns doe fine Lawne, ſo that you Varlets ye ſee, how I like a cruel devill torment this poore ſoule: Is not this a brave trade my nimble dexterous ſlaves? &amp; how often have I at the upſhot got good fees for you alſo?</p>

               <p>Let me have one paſſage with you amongſt the reſt, I had a large fee once given me, when I was Yeoman to Serjeant <hi>Snap-all;</hi> to adventure upon that narrow Sconce
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48383:6"/>called <hi>Ram-Alley.</hi> We had our prize that we went for, but before we could get off, we were invironed by the enemies forces that lay in Ambuſcado, but we were ſo impriſon'd, ſo ſentenc'd, ſo ſhav'd, ſo trimm'd, ſo annointed, ſo waſhed, ſo ſlaſhed, and gaſhed, that had we not ſtuncke ſo miſerably, I look't for no other preferment then to have beene ſlic'd out for ſteakes for a breakefaſt; but at laſt it was generally reſolved on, that ſeeing we were ſuch ſtinking Carrion, wee were fitter for Fiſhes or Duckes then for men, and ſo in a deſperate manner, we were flung over the Caſtle walls into the water, either to ſwimme or drowne, I never was in ſuch hot ſervice before, and will never adventure it the ſecond time; ſee the markes they gave me on my face, head, hands, limbes, and buttockes. Ile rather turne futurer to my Lord Majors kennell of hounds, and be bound all my life to carry guts to the Beares for a penny a day, then ever bee preſſed upon that thankleſſe ſervice againe.</p>

               <p>There was a rumor the other day, but I hope 'tis but a report, that our Deanes ſhould be ſearched, and our Officers examined, about unjuſt fees, and unlawfull impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, 'twas ſaid too that the Serjeants ſhould be reduc'd to their pied-party-coloured-coats, and to anſwer to all ſuch priſoners as ſhould make juſt complaints againſt them, and to give ſatisfaction to the parties wronged, 'twas reported likewiſe that priſoners ſhould pay but two pence a night for their lodging, and not above four pence a meale, and that Serjeants ſhould not arreſt on the Lords day, and ſuch as would not weare ſuch coats, ſhould be put out of office, and many ſuch hard Impoſitions.</p>
